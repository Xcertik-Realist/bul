This script does the following:

Asks the user for a license key.
Checks the key against the specified license URL.
If the key is valid, fetches the script content from the specified URL.
Writes the fetched script content to a temporary file.
Executes the temporary script using the subprocess module.
Remember that this script is a basic example and lacks proper error handling, security measures, and user feedback. It's also important to note that this approach is not a secure way to handle licensing, as it can be easily circumvented. For more secure licensing solutions, consider using third-party libraries or online services that specialize in software licensing.
